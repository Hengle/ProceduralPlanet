# ProceduralPlanet

This is an experimental project to procedurally generate a planet-like mesh, using several sub-meshes arranged in an icosphere that sub-divide into more detailed meshes when the camera approaches them.

A build for this project can be downloaded here: https://theblackmezek.itch.io/procedural-planet-demo
